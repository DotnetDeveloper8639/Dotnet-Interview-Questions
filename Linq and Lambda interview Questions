1) Explain the difference between LINQ to Objects, LINQ to SQL, and LINQ to Entities.
2) What are deferred execution and immediate execution in LINQ? Provide examples of each.
3) How does lazy loading relate to LINQ? Can you explain how it works and potential pitfalls?
4) Discuss the differences between IQueryable and IEnumerable interfaces in LINQ. When would you use each?
5) What is method chaining in LINQ, and how does it affect query execution?

Ans:- Linq provides set of extension methods form a query. It will follow an order to execute the queries.

var result = dbContext.Customers
                        .Where(c => c.Age > 18)
                        .OrderBy(c => c.LastName)
                        .Select(c => new { Name = c.FirstName + " " + c.LastName });

6) How do you handle complex joins and groupings in LINQ queries? Can you provide examples?

  Ans:-var query = from customer in db.Customers
            join order in db.Orders
            on customer.CustomerID equals order.CustomerID into customerOrders
            select new
            {
                CustomerID = customer.CustomerID,
                CustomerName = customer.CustomerName,
                TotalOrders = customerOrders.Count(),
                TotalOrderAmount = customerOrders.Sum(o => o.OrderAmount)
            };

7) Explain what query optimization techniques you use in LINQ to improve performance.

Ans:- I personally used o improve query perfonce.
Paging the result using skip and take.
Used filters like where etc.
Avoided fetching unneccessary columns.
Avoided complex calculations
Reduced unncessary joins.
Cached frequently used dat.

8) Discuss the role of anonymous types in LINQ queries. Provide an example of when you would use them.

Ans:-Anonymous types are used to create set of readonly properties.
In linq we will create these anonymous types without using DTO classes.
let totalCalHrs = (from service in _context.TblServices.Where(s => s.project_id == p.id)
                   join sm in _context.TblServiceMachines on service.id equals sm.service_id
                   join hrs in _context.TblMachineHour on sm.id equals hrs.service_machine_id
                   select new
                   {
                       CalculatedHours = hrs.calculated_hours
                   }).Sum(s => s.CalculatedHours)

9) Explain the concept of expression trees in LINQ. How are they used internally, and what benefits do they provide?

In LINQ, expression trees represent code in the form of data structures rather than executable code. 
They are used internally by LINQ providers, 
such as Entity Framework or LINQ to SQL, to translate LINQ queries into a format that can be understood and executed by a data source, 
such as a database.

10) How do you handle paging and sorting in LINQ queries efficiently?
Discuss the concept of projections in LINQ and their importance in optimizing query performance.
What are some common anti-patterns or pitfalls to avoid when writing LINQ queries?
Explain how you would handle complex filtering and conditional logic in LINQ queries using lambda expressions.
Discuss the use of GroupBy and aggregation functions (such as Sum, Average, Count) in LINQ queries.
How do you handle NULL values and exceptions in LINQ queries effectively?
Can you provide an example of using LINQ to perform data manipulation operations, such as insertions, updates, and deletions?
Discuss the benefits and limitations of using LINQ over traditional SQL queries.
Explain the concept of query composition and how you would use it to build dynamic queries with LINQ.
How do you handle complex inheritance and polymorphic scenarios in LINQ queries?
Discuss the integration of LINQ with other technologies, such as Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core, and WCF (Windows Communication Foundation).
